# Tick-Tac-Toe
## Objectives
The Tic-Tac-Toe project was started in 16 Feb 2022 as a way to learn about Machine Learning.

## Overview
The current implementation has 2 versions of Computer Players (ComputerPlayerV1 & ComputerPlayerV2).
Both these versions computer players that chooses their moves programatically.
It is one of my goals to eventually create a Computer Player that chooses their moves based on the probability of winning the game using an AI model.
